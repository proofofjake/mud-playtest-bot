# MUD Playtest Calender Bot

This is a super simple bot that takes (playtest) events from MUD related servers and adds they to the combined mud playtest calender. 

## Usage;

Once the bot has been added to the given server, running;

the ``` !start [id of notion page] ``` starts the service looking at your server, with the id of your projects notion page

using ``` !stop [id of notion page] ``` will remove it from the bots tracking list :)
